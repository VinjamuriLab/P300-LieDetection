## üìà Results and Insights  
- **Preprocessing Impact**: Filtering and normalization improved accuracy by **~8%**.  
- **Performance Highlights**:  
  - **CNN 1D**: Best-performing model with a **ROC AUC of 0.88**.  
  - **ResNet**: Comparable accuracy with fewer parameters and computational cost.  
- **P300 Responses**: Stronger signals observed with **emotionally or personally significant probes**.

## üß† P300 Analysis  
- **Key Finding**: Stimuli familiarity and emotional relevance influence the presence of P300 signals.  
- Neutral or unfamiliar probes often fail to elicit robust responses.

## üöÄ Future Directions  
- **Multimodal Integration**: Combining EEG data with:  
  - **Skin conductance** (arousal/stress).  
  - **Heart rate** and **oxygen saturation** (physiological insights).  
- **Goal**: Achieve a richer, more accurate deception detection system.

## ‚öôÔ∏èSteps to Run the Model
  
  - This model has been trained on a custom dataset, which cannot be shared at the moment. However, this project is designed to be easily adaptable for other datasets with minimal modifications.
  
  - Follow the steps below to use the model with your own data:

    - **Preprocess Your Data**
      - Prepare your data by creating a CSV file that includes:
        - Signal location
        - Label for each sample

    - **Data Augmentation**
      - To augment the data, run the eeg_data-augmentation.ipynb notebook. This file contains the necessary code to apply various data augmentation techniques to your dataset.

    - **Train the Model**
      - To train the model, execute the train.py script. Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted before running the script.

    - **Organize Your Data**
      - Arrange your pre-processed data in a directory structure like: ./data/pre-processed_raw/...

    Make sure your data is in the correct format for training.

    **Model Output**
    The results, along with the model checkpoints, will be saved in a directory. The output files will be named with the prefix checkpoint to indicate the saved model states.

    **Dataset Folder and Available Models**
    The dataset folder contains different configurations that support:
        - Various types of data augmentation
        Specific parameters like:
            - Normalization
            - Decimation factor
            - Start and end milliseconds for signal cropping

By following these steps and adjusting the dataset and parameters as needed, you can easily adapt the project to other datasets.

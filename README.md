# EEG-Based P300 Detection (Lie detection)
This project explores advanced methodologies for EEG-based deception detection using neurophysiological signals. Below is a concise summary of key sections from the report.  

---

## üîç Methodology for Data Analysis  
- **Preprocessing Steps**:  
  - **Filtering**: Applied 4th-order Butterworth filter (0.5‚Äì30 Hz).  
  - **Normalization**: Ensured consistent signal scaling.  
  - **Signal Cropping**: Focused on the **250‚Äì1000 ms** window for P300 response analysis.  
- **Balancing the Dataset**:  
  - Used **SMOTE** to generate synthetic samples.  
  - Applied **EEG-specific augmentation** for better generalization.

We evaluated several state-of-the-art deep learning models:  

| **Model**          | **Accuracy** | **Parameters (M)** | **FLOPs (MFLOPs)** |  
|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------------|  
| üèÜ **CNN 1D**       | 80.61%       | 10.33               | 35.4               |  
| **ResNet**          | 77.45%       | 1.48                | 188.1              |  
| Transformer         | 60.51%       | 1.63                | 39.8               |  
| ChronoNet           | 57.14%       | 0.02                | 4.2                |  
| EfficientNet        | 59.23%       | 0.31                | 7.1                |

## üìà Results and Insights  
- **Preprocessing Impact**: Filtering and normalization improved accuracy by **~8%**.  
- **Performance Highlights**:  
  - **CNN 1D**: Best-performing model with a **ROC AUC of 0.88**.  
  - **ResNet**: Comparable accuracy with fewer parameters and computational cost.  
- **P300 Responses**: Stronger signals observed with **emotionally or personally significant probes**.

## üß† P300 Analysis  
- **Key Finding**: Stimuli familiarity and emotional relevance influence the presence of P300 signals.  
- Neutral or unfamiliar probes often fail to elicit robust responses.

## üöÄ Future Directions  
- **Multimodal Integration**: Combining EEG data with:  
  - **Skin conductance** (arousal/stress).  
  - **Heart rate** and **oxygen saturation** (physiological insights).  
- **Goal**: Achieve a richer, more accurate deception detection system.
